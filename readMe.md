# Pr√©sentation Village Rescue

_by Marie Rabel_

## What is it ?

This is a game that I made as a project during my IronHack Bootcamp.
All made with Html Css and Js Vanilla.

## Why this game choice ?

When I looked up for ideas, I went searching for assets. I saw the many possibilities and the endless creativity that we can put on a Platform game, so I decided to make one.

## Features

- Platforms engineering and animation
- Main character movements
- Monsters animations
- Items interactivity with collision
- Screen automatic scroll
- Villagers collect

## Issues

- Responsivity for little screen
- Imperfect collision
